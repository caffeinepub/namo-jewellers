# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a static brochure website for Namo Jewellers, a one gram gold jewellery brand, with a premium elegant visual theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Sticky minimal navigation bar with brand name and section links
- Hero section with brand name, tagline, subtitle, three CTA buttons (Shop Now, Visit Store, Call Us), 4.7-star rating badge, and store hours; uses hero banner image as background
- About Us section with brand story, trust messaging, 4.7-star rating highlight, and about illustration image
- Collections section with five category cards (Bridal Collection, Necklaces, Earrings, Bangles & Bracelets, Daily Wear Jewellery), each showing emoji, name, description, and corresponding collection image
- Why Choose Namo Jewellers section listing six selling points with checkmark icons
- Customer Testimonials section with three quotes, star ratings, and prominent 4.7 overall rating display
- Visit Us / Contact section with store hours, Call Us and Get Directions buttons, closing tagline, and contact banner image
- Warm gold, champagne, and ivory color palette with dark accents; serif display font for headings, clean sans-serif for body; spacious layout with gold accent dividers throughout

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a fully styled, multi-section showcase website for Namo Jewellers presenting the brand story, jewellery collections, customer testimonials, and store contact details — with no e-commerce functionality.

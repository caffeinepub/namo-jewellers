  "summary": "The diff implements all six content sections (Hero, About, Collections, Why Choose, Testimonials, Contact) plus navigation, footer, and the premium luxury visual theme. All major requirements are covered. Minor gap: the Contact section's call button is labeled 'Call Now' instead of 'Call Us', but this is cosmetic. The implementation is comprehensive and well-aligned with the build request.",
